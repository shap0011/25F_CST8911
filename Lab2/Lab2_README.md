|  3  | Within the function app create an azure function, via the azure portal. Create an azure blob storage trigger function. Ensure your storage account connection is the storage account created in step 1 | 3     |
|  4  | Test/run the function where if an file gets uploaded in a container, the trigger succeeds                                                                                                              | 5     |
